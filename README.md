# hello-world
Hello fellow coders,
I am glad you stopped by and are interested in viewing some of my projects! I use github to mainly store code for projects I have written in java as I have embarked on a journey of mastering this language. Since much of my technical expertise is in database development you may notice a few errors here and there; mostly not intentionally over-looked. 

However, once you come across such please feel free to correct me as your expertise will definitely be appreciated in ensuring no poorly written code survives the public domain for too long.
Thanks for vising this page and I look forward to hearing from you.
Ian
