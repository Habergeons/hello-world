# hello-world
Hello fellow coders,
I am glad you stopped by and are interested in viewing some of my projects! I use github to mainly store code for projects I have written in java as I have embarked on a journey of mastering this language. Since much of my technology background in in database you may notice a few errors here and there; mostly not intentionally over-looked. However, once you come across such please feel free to correct my as I will be glad to learn from your expertise and will definitely appreciate your time in doing so.
Thanks for vising this page and I look forward to hearing from you.
Ian
